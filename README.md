Simple Substitution Cipher Encryption and Decryption
using a given key of 5 unique letters.
The user enters the key to cipher a message and the same key to decipher the message. The
cipher alphabet is built by adding the remaining 21 letters (excluding the 5 letters entered) in
order after the key letters. For example, if the user enters &quot;zebra&quot; as the key, then:
plain alphabet : a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
cipher alphabet: z e b r a c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y
The, we can encrypt the following sentence as follows:
Plain text : I love C plus plus
Cipher text: g jmua b njtq njtq
If the user enters &quot;cairo&quot; as the key, then:
plain alphabet : a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
cipher alphabet: c a i r o b d e f g h j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z
The, we can encrypt the following sentence as follows:
Plain text : I love C plus plus
Cipher text: f jmvo i njus njus

## Project-Notes
* The Key letters must be unique and just 5 characters no numbers or symbols.
* Any number or symbols in the message will be deleted in encoding.
* You can use uppercase letters but it will convert to lowercase.
